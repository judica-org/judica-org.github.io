stands to be the vehicle that drives this empowerment, but only if the bitcoin
community keeps a dedicated focus on helping all users improve their fiscal
liberty. judica is the platform for bitcoin community to build the projects that
realize bitcoin's potential.
while there are many areas we could focus on, our singular vision is on
creating a...</p><h1>vibrant bitcoin economy.</h1><p>bitcoin is the first native judiciary system for the internet. at judica (hence the name) we
believe we can help bitcoin fulfil its potential as the best judiciary system possible for
the internet. the more sophisticated disputes that can be adjudicated using bitcoin, the
more vibrant the bitcoin economy becomes.</p><h3>how we're accomplishing our mission.</h3><p>we're building a platform for decentralized autonomous organizations
(DAOs) on bitcoin.
a DAO is a group of individuals that collectively manage a treasury of
digital assets with some set of algorithmic rules and objectives
determined by the members. for example, the DAO might endeavor to invest
in scientific research, manage the treasury for a defi protocol, or
administer the issuance art as nfts.
any DAO (and really, any bitcoin smart contract) can use our open
architecture to collectively self-custody and manage bitcoin and other
virtual assets. judica's profit interest -- we are a startup after all
-- is to provide value add apis, services, and support to the DAOs using
-- our open
architecture.</p><p>although DAOs can rightfully be lampooned for a number of reasons --
hallmark 'unserious' applications like buying the constitution; that the
D the A and the O in DAO may not be an accurate description of what they
do or how they function; or big public failures (remember <i>The</i>
DAO) -- they represent a nascent movement for coordinating the formation
of capital on decentralized rails that we're excited to be a part of.</p><h3>why we believe this.</h3><p>does the government create the free market or does the free market create the government?
which came first, the chicken or the egg? regardless of the philosophical implications of
the answer to this question, one can analyze the impact that the government has on the free
market and if that effect inherently increases the freedom of the market or restricts it.</p><p>legislative and executive branches seem to only serve to attempt to manipulate or control
the free market, and often are mere participants in the market when appropriating goods or
services. however the judicial function of government is unique. imagine a world without any
judiciary. it would be nearly impossible to do business as there would be no means of
resolving disputes and enforcing contracts. we'd all still live in caves. fortunately, the
free market demands a judiciary, or the development of the judiciary system to hold men to
their word creates a free market. <i>homo sapiens</i> leave the relative safety of their
caves and our modern society is born.</p><p>endeavoring to create a vibrant bitcoin economy isn't a statement of opinion on the classic
'medium of exchange v. store of value' debate. bitcoin <i>the asset</i> can in many cases be
abstracted out to the reduced role as fungible collateral. rather, a vibrant bitcoin economy
has three main positive effects:</p><ol><li>more diverse use; more security.</li><li>more likely you can use you bitcoin when you need to.</li><li>increases distribution of coins.</li></ol><h1>things we also believe in</h1><hr><h2>self-custody for all.</h2><p>by now we've all heard the maxim, <i>"not your keys, not your coin,"</i> but self custody of
bitcoin can be difficult to use and easy to mess up, leading many users to prefer to use
trusted third parties like exchanges to store their funds. these trusted third parties are
centralized choke points where governments or other nefarious actors may steal coins or
prevent you from spending your coin when you need to. in the free world, our institutions and
rights to due process make these concerns seem less pressing. but bitcoin aspires to be able
to serve users world wide living under less friendly regimes. if history is any lesson,
liberal democratic societies do not always remain so.</p><p>at judica we're bucking the trend of reliance on centralized trusted third parties by
building a future where users are empowered to manage state of the art coin custody
solutions without the need for trusted third parties. we have three guiding principles for
custody we're designing our solutions based on:</p><ol><li>one size does not fit all.</li><li>inaccessible coins are useless.</li><li>minimize access to secure information.</li></ol><h2>unbreakable base layer.</h2><p>bitcoin will be under attack by faceless adversaries threatened by permissionless
censorship-resistant money or those who seek to profit from instability.</p><p>as stewards of the bitcoin protocol, it is our job to stop all such efforts dead in their
tracks. bitcoin is strong, but not unbreakable. though many memes have been made to suggest
otherwise, the reality is that bitcoin's promise of unbreakability is yet to be achieved. at
judica we recognize the reality of what bitcoin is secure against and what it is not.</p><p>where there are gaps between what we expect bitcoin to do and what it actually does, we're
working diligently to discover and patch them. you can't hand wave away security
vulnerabilities, you can only fix them.</p><p>we have three guiding principles for an unbreakable bitcoin:</p><ol><li>fix while ahead: a vector that seems hard to exploit today will seem easier tomorrow.</li><li>don't make assumptions about an attacker's rationality.</li><li>easier to understand code is easier to secure.</li></ol></div><div></div></div><hr><footer style=text-align:center;bottom:0;padding-bottom:10px;width:100%>&copy; Judica, Inc 2022 | contact@judica.org | <a class=darkmode-switch>dark/light theme</a> | <a target=_blank href=https://discord.gg/WfBjavZpmM>discord</a></footer></body></html>
