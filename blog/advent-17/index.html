<a href=https://twitter.com/fiveoutofnine>Eugene</a>, this really smart 19 year old Cal
dropout, when I was visiting Miami for the NFT bachanal around Art Basel.</p><p>Eugene just dropped a project he&rsquo;s been working on, and it&rsquo;s really freakin'
cool. He basically implemented a human v. chess engine in Solidity that mints
beautiful interactive NFTs of representations of the contract&rsquo;s internal states.
You can play the game / mint one for like 0.1 ETH on his site
<a href=https://fiveoutofnine.com>here</a>, and see a permanent record of my
embarassingly bad move where I missed a mate-in-one here:</p><p>Definitely check out the site and read how it&rsquo;s implemented. Eugene is very
bright, and a talented hacker. The project? It&rsquo;s not a get-rich-quick project,
only cost is gas, so Eugene&rsquo;s not raking it in (altho I think he should have,
but he&rsquo;ll have many more successes).</p><h1 id=so-whats-the-moral-of-this-story>So what&rsquo;s the moral of this story?</h1><p>Why isn&rsquo;t Eugene working on Bitcoin? People say that &ldquo;eth is a scam&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;everyone working on it are scammers&rdquo;. But I don&rsquo;t see that. I see people, like
Eugene, wanting to build cool shit every day. And wanting to ship cool stuff.
It&rsquo;s fun. And I like to be friends with creative and curious people.</p><p>Working on Bitcoin is can be fun. But mostly it&rsquo;s not. My post yesterday? The
one describing new techniques to make Bitcoin more decentralized? I had a lot
of fun writing it. And then someone claimed that my work is &ldquo;very dangerous&rdquo; to
Bitcoin.</p><p>I get it, I truly do. Bitcoin is money for enemies. Don&rsquo;t trust, verify. In
the IRC channels, twitter spaces, and other forums we hear rants like the below
all the time:</p><blockquote><p>Working on Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just a stupid fucking game of chess you idiot, it&rsquo;s
solving literally every geoscale challenge humanity has ever faced and your work
on that is a bajillion fold more worthwhile. You are an asshole thinking you
deserve to have any fun in your life when you could be a miserable piece of shit
with people shouting at you all the time about how you suck and struggling to
ship small features and hoping how you might ship one bigger project this
decade. Fun? Fun??? You fucking asshole. If I don&rsquo;t kill you, someone else will.</p></blockquote><p>But developers are people too, and good developers like to build cool shit. If
you haven&rsquo;t noticed, Bitcoin development has a bit of a burnout problem, with
multiple contributors stepping down their engagement recently. A likely cause
is the struggle it takes to ship even the smallest features, not to mention the
monumental effort it takes to ship a single large project. But the death
threats certainly don&rsquo;t help either.</p><h3 id=it-doesnt-have-to-be-this-hard>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this hard</h3><p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell people, especially younger folk just entering the space, to
work on Bitcoin full-time. What I say is as follows:</p><blockquote><p>If you have a strong ideological calling to the mission of Bitcoin and sound money,
it&rsquo;s absolutely the most meaningful project for you to work on. But if that&rsquo;s not you,
and you want to explore crypto, you should probably play around with Ethereum or
something else. Bitcoin is really tough to get funded for and the community,
while amazing, can be very hostile.</p></blockquote><p>If I were more selfish about the mission, I&rsquo;d glaze over these details. But I
want folks to decide for themselves and find something that makes them truly
happy. For most &ldquo;at-heart&rdquo; Bitcoiners that won&rsquo;t be a disincentive to taking
the orange-pill, but for some it might. Note: I&rsquo;m Jewish, so that probably
influence my views on converting people to things (Jews believe in discouraging
converts to find the pure of heart).</p><p>Despite my best efforts to convince myself otherwise, I&rsquo;ve been an audit-the-fed
libertarian since elementary school or something and I have photos of myself
with Ron Paul a decade apart. So I am one of those ideologically drawn to
Bitcoin and not other projects with weaker foundations.</p><p>But it doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t turn an envious eye to the activity and research
happening in other communities, or get excited about on-chain chess engines even
if they&rsquo;re impractical for now. And there&rsquo;s also the magic of a supportive
communtiy that doesn&rsquo;t threaten to have you beaten up when they disagree with
you about the minutae of a soft fork rollout.</p><p>Cool technologies attract nerds like moths to a lamp at night. Smart nerds
trying to solve interesting problems create solutions. Experiments that strain
the limits of a platform expose problems and create demand for solutions.
These solutions often have major positive externalities.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to convince you here to care about NFTs. But I am &ndash;
hopefully &ndash; going to convince you to care about NFTs the phenomenon.</p><p>For example, scaling challenge in Ethereum have led to the development of Zero
Knowledge Roll-Ups, privacy issues things like Tornado Cash, and more. While as
a project Eth might be #ngmi, Bitcoiners have traditionally said that if
anything is worth having we&rsquo;ll just be able to implement it ourselves in
Bitcoin. But there are certain things that have network effects where it will be
hard for us to replicate. And by the time we do go to replicate, the tooling
that&rsquo;s been developed for doing these things on Eth might be like a decade ahead
of what we&rsquo;ve got for Bitcoin. And all of the smart kids are going to become
adults who are bought in technically and socially on things other than Bitcoin.
And that really freakin&rsquo; matters.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not advocating that Bitcoiners should embrace full-blown degeneracy. But
also it&rsquo;s not in particular our job to prevent it technically. And the tools that
are produced when people have fun can lead to major innvoations.</p><p>For example, right now I am working on a system for building NFTs for Bitcoin on
Sapio.</p><p>Why? It&rsquo;s fun. It touches on almost all of the infrastructure problems I&rsquo;m
working on for Sapio right now. And it is low enough risk &ndash; in terms of risk of
losing Bitcoin &ndash; that I feel comfortable building and experimenting with these
NFT test-subjects. Worst-come-to-worst, the artists can always re-issue anything
corrupted via a software flaw. And then as the software matures with low-risk
but still fun applications, we can apply those learnings to managing Bitcoin as
well.</p><p>I also want to note that I really like artists. Artists as a community are
incredible. Artists use NFTs, so I like NFTs. Artists are the voice of the
people. Art can tear down the establishment. Art can change the world. And so
for Bitcoin, whose use is an inherently political message, what better community
to engage than the art world?</p><p>Bitcoiners are really fixated on the technical nonsense backing NFTs &ndash; yeah,
it&rsquo;s not &rsquo;literally&rsquo; the artwork. But then again, what literally is the
artwork? If you want a photograph and you want to pay the photographer for it,
do you? Do you get a receipt for it? Can you use that bill of sale to sell the
photo later? NFTs are just a better that. And if you don&rsquo;t <em>like</em> the art that&rsquo;s
sold as NFTs right now, why not find artists you do like? Why not get them
onboarded onto Bitcoin and fully orange-pilled? Hint: the HRF has a whole <a href=https://hrf.org/programs/art-in-protest/>Art
in Protest</a> section on their website.
Bitcoin NFTs could enable Bitcoin holders to pay dissident artists for their art
and avoid being shut down by authorities. Why not embrace that culturally? Isn&rsquo;t
that the group that Bitcoin is for? And if you don&rsquo;t like that, maybe you just
don&rsquo;t like art. That&rsquo;s ok, don&rsquo;t buy it.</p><h2 id=but-nfts-are-stupid-jpegs-man>But NFTs are Stupid JPEGs Man</h2><p>Ok sure. Whatever.</p><p>But there are all these contracts (as I showed you in previous posts) that
Bitcoin would benefit from, like inheritence schemes, vaults, decentralized
mining, payment pools, and more. Believe it or not, there tools needed to make
NFTs work well are the exact same tools required to make these work seamlessly.</p><p>So why not have a little fun, let people experiment with new ideas, get excited,
grow the community, and convert the big innovations into stable and mature
tooling for the critical infrastructure applications? And maybe we&rsquo;ll uncover
some upside for brand new things that never occured possible to us before.</p><p>Throught the end of this series I&rsquo;ll have some more posts detailing how to build
NFTs, Derivatives, DAOs, and Bonded Oracles. I hope that you can view them with
an open mind and appreciate how &ndash; even if you don&rsquo;t think they are core to what
Bitcoin has to do &ndash; these innovations will fuel development of tools to support
the projects you do like without turning Bitcoin into a shitcoin. Who knows,
maybe you&rsquo;ll find a new application you like.</p></div><div></div></div><hr><div class=main2><div></div><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//judica-org.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a><div></div></div><hr><footer style=text-align:center;bottom:0;padding-bottom:10px;width:100%>&copy; Judica, Inc 2022 | contact@judica.org | <a class=darkmode-switch>dark/light theme</a></footer></body></html>
