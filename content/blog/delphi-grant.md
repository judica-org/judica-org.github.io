On May 11th, 2020 [Delphi Digital](https://delphidigital.io), a leading cryptocurrency market
research organization, put out their [2020 State of Bitcoin
Report](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/the-state-of-bitcoin-2020-3/) which named BIP-119 as a
key technology on Bitcoin's roadmap. The report is great, and accessible at no cost so
definitely check it out!

To celebrate the halving, they sold some Bitcoin Halving shirts with a pledge to use the profits to
support bitcoin development.

Delphi Digital generously chose to use the profits (and a matching amount out of their pocket) to
support Judica's work on BIP-119 with a $1000 gift!

Big thanks to Delphi Digital for their support, we hope to give you a lot to write about in the
coming year!
