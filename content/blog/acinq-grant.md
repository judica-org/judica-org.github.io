In April 2020, I chimed in on the mailing list to ask if there was interest in funding work to
[improve the
mempool](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-April/002660.html).

In mid-June, I got an e-mail from Pierre-Marie Padiou, the CEO of ACINQ, offering a $10k grant to
support this work. ACINQ is one of the leading Lightning Network companies, so it makes sense that
they are prioritizing R&D to improve the mempool, but it's very meaningful that an earlier stage
startup is stepping up and dedicating resources to a commons project. Bravo ACINQ!

You can read more about how this grant is going to advance our [mission](/mission/) in our post on
the [mempool](/blog/mempool/).
