    <h1> self-custody for all.</h1>
    <p>
        by now we've all heard the maxim, <i>"not your keys, not your coin,"</i> but self custody of
        bitcoin can be difficult to use and easy to mess up, leading many users to prefer to use
        trusted third parties like exchanges to store their funds. these trusted third parties are
        centralized choke points where governments or other nefarious actors may steal coins or
        prevent you from spending you coin when you need to. in the free world, our institutions and
        rights to due process make these concerns seem less pressing. but bitcoin aspires to be able
        to serve users world wide living under less friendly regimes. if history is any lesson,
        liberal democratic societies do not always remain so.
    </p>

    <p> 
        at judica we're bucking the trend of reliance on centralized trusted third parties by
        building a future where users are empowered to manage state of the art coin custody
        solutions without the need for trusted third parties. we have three guiding principles for
        custody we're designing our solutions based on:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>one size does not fit all.</li>
        <li>inaccessible coins are useless.</li>
        <li>minimize access to secure information.</li>
    </ol>


    <h1>vibrant bitcoin economy.</h1>
    <p>
        does the government create the free market or does the free market create the government?
        which came first, the chicken or the egg? regardless of the philosophical implications of
        the answer to this question, one can analyze the impact that the government has on the free
        market and if that effect inherently increases the freedom of the market or restricts it.
    </p>
    <p>
        legislative and executive branches seem to only serve to attempt to manipulate or control
        the free market, and often are mere participants in the market when appropriating goods or
        services. however the judicial function of government is unique. imagine a world without any
        judiciary. it would be nearly impossible to do business as there would be no means of
        resolving disputes and enforcing contracts. we'd all still live in caves. fortunately, the
        free market demands a judiciary, or the development of the judiciary system to hold men to
        their word creates a free market. <i>homo sapiens</i> leave the relative safety of their
        caves and our modern society is born.
    </p>

    <p>
        bitcoin is the first native judiciary system for the internet. at judica (hence the name) we
        believe we can help bitcoin fulfil its potential as the best judiciary system possible for
        the internet. the more sophisticated disputes that can be adjudicated using bitcoin, the
        more vibrant the bitcoin economy becomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        endeavoring to create a vibrant bitcoin economy isn't a statement of opinion on the classic
        'medium of exchange v. store of value' debate. bitcoin <i>the asset</i> can in many cases be
        abstracted out to the reduced role as fungible collateral. rather, a vibrant bitcoin economy
        has three main positive effects:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>more diverse use; more security.</li>
        <li>more likely you can use you bitcoin when you need to.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
